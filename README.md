This is a sample Node.js repository created for testing purposes. It includes dependencies with known security vulnerabilities and some code that may trigger CodeQL alerts.

## Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities

- **express**: 4.16.0 (has known CVEs)
- **lodash**: 4.17.4 (has CVE-2019-10744)
- **minimist**: 1.2.0 (has CVE-2020-7598)

## Code Vulnerabilities
